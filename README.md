# Byrsa Archive (Static)
 This is a static repository mirroring the restructured dataset from my 2021 MA thesis, "The Byrsa's Second Death: Reconstruction and Erasure in the Heart of Colonial Carthage" ([https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0401823](https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0401823)). All files in this repository are also included in the supplementary files for my thesis, which can be found at [http://hdl.handle.net/2429/79727](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/79727).
